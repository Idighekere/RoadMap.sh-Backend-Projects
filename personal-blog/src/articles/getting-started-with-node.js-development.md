Node.js has revolutionized how we think about JavaScript development. In this guide, we'll explore the fundamentals of Node.js and why it's become such a popular choice for modern web development.

## What is Node.js?

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. This opened up new possibilities for using JavaScript on the server side.

## Key Features

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Non-blocking I/O operations
   - Asynchronous programming model
   - Event loop for handling concurrent operations

2. **Package Management**
   - NPM (Node Package Manager)
   - Vast ecosystem of open-source packages
   - Easy dependency management

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

```bash
# Install Node.js
node -v
npm -v

# Create a new project
mkdir my-node-project
cd my-node-project
npm init -y
```

## Writing Your First Node.js Application

Here's a simple HTTP server:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
    res.end('Hello World\n');
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running at http://localhost:3000/');
});
```
